AppStoreReviewGuidelines
========================

A version history of Apple's App Store Review Guidelines. Apple has not yet (as of August 14, 2013) included a version history on the review guidelines page.

This is a work in progress. Submit older versions if you happen to have them. 

For lack of a more graceful solution, I'm simply stripping the `<head>` from the page source, and saving the result in an html file with the following naming scheme:

asrg-YYYY-MM-DD.html

where Y's, M's, and D's are obviously dates.
