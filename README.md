AppStoreReviewGuidelines
========================

A version history of Apple's App Store Review Guidelines. Apple has not yet (as of March 30, 2014) included a version history on the review guidelines page.

This is a work in progress. Submit older versions if you happen to have them. 

For lack of a more graceful solution, I'm simply stripping the `<head>` from the page source, and saving the result in an html file with the following naming scheme:

asrg-YYYY-MM-DD.html

where Y's, M's, and D's are obviously dates.

Check out the `most-recent-version.html` for a [running diff](https://github.com/jaredsinclair/AppStoreReviewGuidelines/commits/master/most-recent-version.html) of the most recent changes.
