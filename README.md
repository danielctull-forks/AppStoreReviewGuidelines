# App Store Review Guidelines
*A version history of Apple's [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/).* 

Apple has not yet (as of September 3, 2014) included a version history on the review guidelines page. This project serves as a simple way to track changes in the App Store Guidelines. 

## How it Works
Check out the `most-recent-version.html` for a [running diff](https://github.com/jaredsinclair/AppStoreReviewGuidelines/commits/master/most-recent-version.html) of the most recent changes.

## Contributing
This is a work in progress. Versions currently only date as far back as April 14, 2014. You can help by submitting older versions (if you happen to have them). 

For lack of a more graceful solution, this is the process:
 1. Copy the [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/) webpage source code (HTML).  
 2. Strip the `<head>` from the page source.  
 3. Save the result in an HTML file with the naming scheme below, where Y's, M's, and D's are obviously dates.   
        asrg-YYYY-MM-DD.html

## App Review
In addition to the App Store Review Guidelines you may want to take a look at Apple's new webpage, [*Common App Rejections*](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/rejections/).

Good luck with your next app review! Hope this serves as a useful resource!
